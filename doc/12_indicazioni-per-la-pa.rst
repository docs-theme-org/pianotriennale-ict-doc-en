   **This document was translated by a machine.**

   We want to make our country more efficient. We believe humans and machines should complement each other. Artificial Intelligence is the technology that will enable such symbiosis. This document has been translated using a mix of state-of-the-art machine translation and human-driven AI. The raw machine translation output has been edited by an automated system trained on millions of professionally corrected sentences. Finally, a human went through the document to make sure that no information had been lost.

   This means leaving behind some stylistic improvements and potential errors. However, this AI-augmented approach to translation allowed us to prepare this English version at a fraction of the cost and time of the legacy translation process (this translation was made in a few days including the human review; we didnâ€™t publish it right away because we had to convert it to reStructuredText in order to share it on GitHub and we had a ton of things to do before that!).

Indications for the Public administrations
==========================================

The Plan provides for a number of PA actions, some of which have already
been initiated. To speed up the implementation path of each
administration, refer to Annex 2 for an overview of conventions and
other active procurement tools. It is underlined that in addition to the
traditional *procurement* tools, the PAs can use forms of collaboration
to accelerate implementation times and reduce costs and risks of
failure. Amongst the forms currently in use and which will have to be
adopted by the administrations, which are not capable of achieving the
objectives by themselves within the times provided, are:

-  **collaboration agreements for the management of application
   services**: participation in collaboration agreements between
   administrations that have decided to share in the implementation of
   common platforms; in this case the already existing cooperation
   agreements between some regions reoccur;

-  **"ancillary" solutions**: use of "ancillary" applicative solutions
   through agreements between the PAs that have already developed
   strategic and non-operational initiatives; such agreements, which may
   be different, depending on the project, must have characteristics
   such as to guarantee their sustainability;

-  use of **"in reuse" solutions**, as an alternative to "ancillary"
   ones, in cases where the suitability has been evaluated;

-  use of infrastructure services made available by other
   administrations.

Below is a summary of all actions that involve the Public
Administrations described in detail in the previous chapters.

Indications related to *Data Centres* and to the *cloud*
--------------------------------------------------------

**Public Administrations cannot create new *Data
Centres***\  [91]_\ ***,*** and can only adapt the existing data centres
exclusively to:

-  avoid problems of interruption of public service;

-  anticipate discharging processes for the acquisition of SPC-Cloud
   tender competition *services*;

-  consolidate their services on *data centres* of other PAs in order to
   obtain cost savings.

Below are the actions planned for the three-year period 2017-2019:

Connectivity Tips
------------------

Expenditure sustained by administrations for the charges for
connectivity services does not fall within the objective of containing
expenditure for the three-year period 2016-2018, pursuant to Article 1
paragraph 515 of the 2016 Stability Law.

Below are the actions planned for the three-year period 2017-2019.

+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| From 2017   | The Public Administrations will adjust their connection capacity to ensure the full deployment of strategic services and platforms, by adopting alternately:                                                                                                                                       |

| From 2018   | The administrations define and implement the Adaptation Plan to the guidelines issued by AgID for the *Wi-Fi* systems that facilitate access to the Internet network from public offices and public places.                                                                                        |
+-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Information on Public Administration Data and DAF
--------------------------------------------------

The PAs are required to adapt databases and registers that already
operate according to the rules set out in section 4.1.

The PAs will need to use databases of national interest in conjunction
with AgID in accordance with the programming set out in the specific
implementation plans by the PA holding the individual national database.
Failure to comply with these plans must be notified to AgID as it
differs from the provisions of this Plan and represents an expenditure
inconsistent with the principles of saving set out in Article 1
paragraph 515 of the 2016 Stability Law.

Below are the actions planned for the three-year period 2017-2019.

plans with intangible infrastructures according to the times and
procedures established in the programmes of the individual platforms and
strategic projects: SPID, PagoPA, ANPR, electronic invoicing, ComproPA,
SIOPE+, NoiPA, etc.

Administrations cannot support costs for the acquisition of autonomous
solutions, nor for evolutionary application adjustments, which provide a
functionality similar to those offered by enabling platforms and the
strategic projects referred to in paragraph 4.2.

It is understood that the costs of integration of their information
systems with enabling platforms and strategic projects are eligible, and
that these costs are included in the costs for innovation, and are
therefore excluded from the savings targets provided for in Article 1
paragraph 515 of the 2016 Stability Law. Public administrations that, on
dates set out by the single platform or strategic project, have failed
to provide a firm plan for integration, will have to adopt solutions
made available by AgID or other administrations (such as platforms
implemented by regions) according to subsidiarity logic.

Below are the actions planned for the three-year period 2017-2019.

+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2017        | **SPID**: The administrations will continue the process of migrating to the Public System of Digital Identity (SPID) by ensuring coverage of all existing digital services, in accordance with AgID's rules. The administrations will only use the SPID system for newly-activated services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|             | **PagoPA**: by December, administrations will need to complete their membership of the PagoPA system for all services that arrange for the payments due by citizens and businesses, according to AgID's rules. Administrations that have not yet completed their membership to the PagoPA system by June will have to adopt, according to a logic of subsidiarity, already available solutions implemented by other administrations (e.g., regional or other administration platforms), which offer the role of intermediary as provided by the PagoPA system.   |

|             | **ComproPA**: by September, MEF, MIT, ANAC, AgID, Consip, the regions and ANCI will complete the rules and start implementing the infrastructures necessary for the operation of the ComproPA system. The administrations involved, being holders of databases of a national interest (such as INPS, INAIL, the Ministry of Justice), will embark on the integration of their systems with the BDOE Economic Operator database feed-in procedures as defined by the decree currently being issued by the MIT.                                                    |

transition from current to future applicative cooperation that includes
an API-based approach.

Below are the actions planned for the three-year period 2017-2019.

+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2017   | From May, the Public Administrations shall adopt the *Guidelines for transition to the new Inter-operability Model* for the existing platforms.                                        |

+--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Instructions on Ecosystems
---------------------------

For each ecosystem, the AgID recommends, in line with the priorities set
out in the "2014-2020 Digital Growth Strategy", the establishment of an
*Ecosystem Working Group* (hereinafter GdL).

+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2017   | From May, the GdLs, for the individual ecosystems, will follow the operational activities for the realisation of Ecosystems through the identification of specific ecosystem objectives, project planning and the establishment of technical discussion sites.   |
+--------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2018   | By December, the regional administrations will have to implement their own regional electronic healthcare filing systems, inter-operable with the national infrastructure.                                                                                       |
