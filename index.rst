   **This document was translated by a machine.**

   We want to make our country more efficient. We believe humans and machines should complement each other. Artificial Intelligence is the technology that will enable such symbiosis. This document has been translated using a mix of state-of-the-art machine translation and human-driven AI. The raw machine translation output has been edited by an automated system trained on millions of professionally corrected sentences. Finally, a human went through the document to make sure that no information had been lost.

   This means leaving behind some stylistic improvements and potential errors. However, this AI-augmented approach to translation allowed us to prepare this English version at a fraction of the cost and time of the legacy translation process (this translation was made in a few days including the human review; we didnâ€™t publish it right away because we had to convert it to reStructuredText in order to share it on GitHub and we had a ton of things to do before that!).

   If there are significant differences between the italian and the english version of the Three Year Plan, we remind you that only the italian version approved every year by the Italian Government has legal value.
